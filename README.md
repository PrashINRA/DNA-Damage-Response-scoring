# DNA-Damage-Response-scoring

Single-cell transcriptional and chromatin signatures of DNA damage response can be quantified using UCell scoring of curated gene sets. This approach enables robust per-cell quantification of true DNA damage signaling activity  while regressing out replication-stress signatures.
